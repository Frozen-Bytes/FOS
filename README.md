# What is this project?
This project involves creating a fully functional operating system in C. It is considered one of the most challenging projects at Ain Shams University, with some students even finding it more difficult than the graduation project due to its complexity.

The project aims to develop a system that manages memory, schedules processes, and ensures protection for shared resources.

The team consisted of six members who worked collaboratively on all the features in the [issues](https://github.com/Frozen-Bytes/FOS/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed), regularly reviewed each other's code, and had fun conversations in the [pull requests](https://github.com/Frozen-Bytes/FOS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), tracked their progress in [GitHub projects](https://github.com/Frozen-Bytes/FOS/projects?query=is%3Aclosed), followed [coding](https://github.com/Frozen-Bytes/FOS/blob/main/CODESTYLE.md) and [contribution](https://github.com/Frozen-Bytes/FOS/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) conventions, and developed, debugged, and tested multiple OS functionalities in C.
