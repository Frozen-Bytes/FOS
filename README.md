# What is FOS?
[FOS](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-828-operating-system-engineering-fall-2012/) is an educational OS for Ain Shams University Operating Systems Course, forked and refactored from [MIT Operating Systems Lab 6.828.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-828-operating-system-engineering-fall-2012/) It was created by [Dr. Mahmoud Hossam](https://github.com/mahossam/) and currently maintained and lectured by [Dr. Ahmed Salah](mailto:ahmed_salah@cis.asu.edu.eg).

# What is this project?
This project involves creating a fully functional operating system in C. It is considered one of the most challenging projects at Ain Shams University, with some students even finding it more difficult than the graduation project due to its complexity.

The goal of this project is to develop a system that manages resources, schedules processes, ensures protection, provides easy-to-use abstractions of physical resources, and handles memory efficiently.

The team consists of six members, each focusing on different components of the system to ensure smooth development. Throughout the project, we will apply various technical skills, including C programming and low-level debugging.

# Learned Concepts
- What is an OS and Kernel.
- How the OS is an illusionist.
- How the OS enables multiple processes to run simultaneously.
- How the OS context switches between processes.
- How the OS handles interrupts, exceptions, and system calls.
- How the OS manages memory and gives the illusion to every application that it has the whole memory to itself using Paging and Segmentation.
